**Collaborative Github info:**
To work with branches:

1. Create branch of your name in the branches settings (can do on github website by using the "New Branch" button or from local device using "git checkout -n BRANCH_NAME")
2. from your local device/terminal/VSCode:
3. use "git checkout <yourname>" to switch to your branch
4. use "git pull" to ensure your branch is up to date and use "git merge" or "git merge main" to ensure you have everyone else's up to date
5. use "git push" from your branch to save local changes (after doing "git add ." and "git commit -m "commit message"")
6. navigate to main using "git checkout main"
7. use "git merge <yourname>" to update the main branch with the changes from your branch, then use "git push" to ensure all is up to date

8. if you are behind main, switch to your branch ("git checkout <yourname>") and then merge with main using "git merge main" and then "git push main" to update on website

After these steps/using these commands, your branch should show 0 steps behind and 0 steps ahead of main.
